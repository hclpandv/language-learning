for a valid sentence in Norsk. 

1. **There must be a verb and a subject**

Hence, we must have a subject telling us who is perforning the action.

```
Jeg er norsk
Det er en mann
Han kommer fra norge
Når bor han i Oslo
```

2. **The verb is in the second position**

this is the main rule. also reffered as v2 rule. 

```
Han snakker norsk nå
Nå snakker han norsk
Tom og Lisa snakker norsk nå ("Tom og lisa" considered a single and first element here)
```
   
5. **The subject is in the first or third position**

```
Han snakker norsk nå
Nå snakker han norsk
Han kan snakke nork nå
Nå kan han snakke nork ( If the subject is not first, and there are more than one verb, the subject
will split the verbs)
```


7. **The negation is behind the verb**
