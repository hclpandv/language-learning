## Sentence Framing in Norwegian | Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

### 1. Basic Structure:

- Norwegian sentences are often structured like English, with a subject (who or what the sentence is about), a verb (action or state), and an object (the thing or person affected by the action).

**English:** I love pizza.
**Norwegian:** Jeg elsker pizza.

### 2. Pronouns:

- In Norwegian, pronouns are used to replace names or nouns. Here are some examples:
  - **Jeg** liker iskrem. (I like ice cream)
  - **Hun** leser en bok. (She reads a book)

### 3. Questions:

- To ask questions in Norwegian, you can switch the order of the subject and verb. For example:
  - **Du leker.** (You play.)
  - **Leker du?** (Are you playing?)

### 4. Negation:

- To make a sentence negative, use the word "ikke" after the verb:
  - **Jeg liker sjokolade.** (I like chocolate.)
  - **Jeg liker ikke sjokolade.** (I don't like chocolate.)

### 5. Possessive Pronouns:

- Possessive pronouns in Norwegian often come after the noun:
  - **Boken min** er spennende. (My book is exciting.)
  - **Hunden din** er søt. (Your dog is cute.)

### 6. Emphasizing Objects:

- In Norwegian, you can emphasize objects by placing them at the beginning of the sentence:
  - **Bil** er morsom. (A car is fun.)
  - **Bil** liker jeg. (A car is what I like.)

### 7. Common Phrases:

- Here are some common phrases for everyday conversations:
  - **Hei! Hvordan har du det?** (Hello! How are you?)
  - **Takk for hjelpen!** (Thanks for the help!)

### 8. Adjectives:

- Adjectives usually come after the noun:
  - **En rød bil**. (A red car.)
  - **En søt katt**. (A cute cat.)

### 9. Time and Place:

- Usually, time and place expressions come after the subject or at the end of the sentence:
  - **Hun jobber i Oslo.** (She works in Oslo.)
  - **Jeg leker på stranden.** (I play on the beach.)

### 10. Joining Clauses:

- Use conjunctions like "og" (and), "men" (but), and "for" (because) to join clauses:
- **Jeg liker å lese, men jeg liker ikke å skrive.** (I like to read, but I don't like to write.)
